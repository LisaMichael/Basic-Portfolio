        <p>Hello Internet. My name is Lisa Michael.  I currently live in Hough's Neck Massachusetts. 
            I am married and have 3 children.  I am currently employed by HCL Technologies. I provide technical support 
            for a suite of products. The products I support are: Lotus Notes, Domino Server, Sametime, Websphere Portal, 
            IBM Connections, now HCL Connections. I also support an application called Big Fix. Big Fix pushes out fixes from a server 
            to workstations. Another application I support is called AppScan. AppScan can scan your web pages and source 
            code for security vulnerabilities. The last two applications I support are Websphere Commerce and Unica. 
            Most of the applications I support are Java applications. I decided almost a year ago, to start studying Java
            in my free time.
            I aspire to become a Software developer. I love figuring out what makes things tick. I am creative. 
            I am a Web Enthusiast. I want to hope to use all of the qualities, and become the Greatest Web Application Developer 
            Ever. 
         </p>
         <p> My Hobbies include: playing old school video games , pinball and billiards.
