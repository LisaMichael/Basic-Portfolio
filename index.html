            <p class="ptext">Hello Internet. My name is Lisa Michael. I currently live in Hough's Neck Massachusetts.
                I am married and have 3 children. I am currently employed by HCL Technologies. I provide technical
                support
                for a suite of products. The products I support are: Lotus Notes, Domino Server, Sametime, Websphere
                Portal,
                IBM Connections, now HCL Connections. I also support an application called Big Fix. Big Fix pushes out
                fixes from a server
                to workstations. Another application I support is called AppScan. AppScan can scan your web pages and
                source
                code for security vulnerabilities. The last two applications I support are Websphere Commerce and Unica.
                Most of the applications I support are Java applications that run on top of Websphere. I decided almost a year ago, to start studying
                Java
                in my free time. Since I started supporting an application that runs security checks on web applications 
                and source code, I thought taking this boot camp would help my career. 
                I aspire to become a Software developer. I love figuring out what makes things tick. I am creative.
                I am a Web Enthusiast. I want to hope to use all of the qualities, and become the Greatest Web
                Application Developer Ever.  
            </p>
            <p> My Hobbies include: playing old school video games , pinball and billiards.

                I also enjoy outdoor shows, checking out live bands and gardening.
                After this class, I would like to continue studying Java, and / or study Ruby on Rails.
                
            </p>
